# Cockhouse - an automated door system for your henhouse

Just set the _open_ and _close_ hours for your chicken farm with the DIP switches and
you won't have to wake up at 5AM to open the door anymore.

The entire project is based on an ATMega8A reading the time from a RTC and controlling a 
motor with a H-bridge. The motor should have a worm gear.
